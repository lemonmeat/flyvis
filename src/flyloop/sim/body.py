"""Fly bodies driven by the closed loop.

Every body exposes the same small interface, so the eyes, vision, LPTC layer and
controller never depend on which body is used:

    body.reset()
    body.step(command, dt, disturbance)   # (3,) roll, pitch, yaw
    body.orientation                      # (3, 3) body -> world rotation
    body.position                         # (3,) world frame
    body.omega                            # (3,) body-frame angular velocity, deg/s

Axes follow flyloop.sim.world: body x forward, y left, z up. Angular velocities
are right-handed about the body's roll (x), pitch (y) and yaw (z) axes: +yaw
turns left (counter-clockwise seen from above), +pitch tilts the nose down, +roll
lowers the right side. A later flybody (MuJoCo) body would implement the same
interface by mapping the command onto its released flight controller.

    Command and disturbance are torques expressed as the steady angular velocity
    (deg/s) they would produce on their own, i.e. torque divided by the
    aerodynamic damping coefficient; tau = moment of inertia / damping. A constant
    disturbance d with no command makes the fly rotate at d deg/s (the
    "simulated wing imbalance" of Leonte et al. 2021).

    Args:
        tau_s: Damping time constant(s), scalar or per axis (roll, pitch, yaw).
            Flapping flight is strongly damped, so this is a few wingbeats to tens
            of ms; 0.05 s is a placeholder to be checked against measurements.
        max_command_deg_s: Saturation of the steering command.
        forward_speed: Constant speed along the body x axis (world units/s).
            Drums and spheres are at infinity, so translation only matters for
            later corridor worlds.
        free_axes: Axes the body may rotate about; the others are held fixed.
